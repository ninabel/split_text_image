# OCR Handwritten - Draft

This repository is a **draft** project to experiment with different possibilities for splitting images containing handwritten text into individual text lines.

The main goal is to explore and prototype methods for detecting and segmenting handwritten lines in scanned images or photographs. The code and approaches here are not final and are subject to change as new ideas are tested.

**Note:**  
This is an early-stage draft and not intended for production use. The focus is on trying out various techniques and understanding what works best for handwritten text line segmentation.

Feel free to explore, suggest improvements, or use this as a starting point for your own experiments!
